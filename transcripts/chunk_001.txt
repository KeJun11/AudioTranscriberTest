This is avocado salad, mmmm, it's creamy, it's refreshing, it's almost like a chunky wok.  Finally chop the red onion and pinch it to separate its layers. Now add it to a bowl with cold water  and let it sit for 10 minutes so that it gets a little less sharp. In the meantime, cut the tomatoes  into bite-sized pieces then add them to a bowl. Then cut the cucumber in half, you can remove some  of the seeds if there's too many, then cut it into small dices and add it to the bowl. Now cut  the avocado in half, remove the stone, cut it into dices and scoop it out and into the bowl. Now  take the red onion out of the water, drain it and add it to the bowl. Then I'm going to add  finely chopped parsley and a season with good quality extra virgin olive oil, freshly squeezed lemon  juice, salt and black pepper. Mix gently until the vegetables are coated in the condiments  and the avocado makes the salad slightly creamy. Taste and adjust for salt before serving on a  platter. Easy, right? Guys, I'm going to show you how we like to eat the leftovers of this salad.  Just make some pita chips and add the salad, then add some chickpeas, give it a quick toss,  then add your favorite cheese on top. I like to add feta cheese. With the crispy bread,  it's a delicious meal.
