This is avocado salad.  Mmm, it's creamy, it's refreshing.  It's almost like a chunky wok.  Finally chopped the red onion, then pinch it to separate its layers.  Now add it to a bowl with cold water, and let it sit for 10 minutes,  so that it gets a little less sharp.  In the meantime, cut the tomatoes into bite size pieces, then add them to a bowl.  Then cut the cucumber in half.  You can remove some of the seeds if there's too many.  Then cut it into small dice and add it to the bowl.  Now cut the avocado in half, remove the stone, cut it into dice, and scoop it out and into the bowl.  Now take the red onion out of the water, drain it, and add it to the bowl.  Then I'm going to add finely chopped parsley, and I season with gucuality, extra virgin olive oil.  Freshly squeezed lemon juice, salt, and black pepper.  Mix gently until the vegetables are coated in the condiments, and the avocado makes the salad slightly creamy.  Taste and adjust for salt when we're serving on a platter.  Easy, right?  Guys, I'm going to show you how we like to eat the leftovers of this salad.  Just make some pita chips and add it to the salad.  Then add some chickpeas, give it a quick toss, then add your favorite cheese on top.  I like to add pita cheese with the crispy bread.  It's a delicious meal.
